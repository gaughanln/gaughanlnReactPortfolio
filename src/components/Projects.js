                This is my second attempt at creating and playing around with my
                portfolio, this time using materialize + CSS to style.
                Materialize was used for the CityBike project which I didn't get
                to explore that part as I worked on the Javascript. I wanted to
                continue learning new programs so I took a stab at this.

                Another employee database type application. You can view all
                employees, their position within the company, salary, manager,
                department, and more. If any edits need to be made, they can be

                was to successfully create, update, and delete data in the
                database when testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE. The project
                uses Sequelize, Mysql2, and dotenv. The project was not deployed
                to a live website.
